# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram, if needed>






# Low level design

<for each package in high level design, report class diagram. Each class should detail attributes and operations>









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>











# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
