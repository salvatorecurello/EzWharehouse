# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram, if needed>

Architecture: client-server application

Architectural pattern: 3-layered

# Low level design

<for each package in high level design, report class diagram. Each class should detail attributes and operations>









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>

|  | Class1 | Class2 | Class3 | Class4 | Class5 | Class6 | Class7 | 
| ----------------- |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| FR1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| FR2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| FR3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

| FR6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| FR7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
